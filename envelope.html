        Envelope – Letter to my best friend
      </h2>
My dearest Mia,

Happy birthday! It saddens me to not be there to celebrate and get absolutely plastered on wine with you for this milestone, but hopefully this web page shows how much I love you and care for you.

Lord knows I’m not the best writer among us and it gets even worse when it comes to putting into words what I feel. I start trying to be poetic and then fall into cliches and mushy metaphors, so fingers crossed that instead, by being sort of genuine and straightforward, I strike a chord.

I want to begin with something honest: I’m deeply grateful to you. There’s no dramatic origin story to our friendship; you didn’t save me from a burning house, and I was doing just fine beforehand. But the truth is, ever since you came into my life, everything became increasingly vivid. Just better because you are in it.

It’s fucking hilarious how I describe you to others, it sounds exactly like those people we were laughing about, the ones that go on volunteering trips to Costa Rica to “save marine life” and reconnect with nature and how they describe their experience: “she introduced me to so many experiences and people that I would have never found by myself, life-changing, soul-opening, etc.”. The funny part is, I catch myself saying it like I mean it, and I kind of do.

It’s not just only that you’ve let me tag along on so many awesome moments. Being around you makes me want to dust off old hobbies and get creative. It’s like I time travel to when I was nine: finger painting, rolling down a hill and braiding dolls’ hair. You bring back that raw, unconditioned version of me, before life got complicated, so thank you for reminding me who I’m at my core.

I really value what we have. It’s easy, but not in a boring way, just in that we get each other. I’d say we process things similarly, we speak the same language and I don’t have to overthink or explain myself too much when I’m with you. That means more than I usually say out loud. 

To me you are so powerful in such different ways. You treat people with so much kindness and empathy, but you are still very sturdy in your beliefs and values. You are so smart and knowledgeable without being arrogant, and obviously, face card is an American Express Black Card, body tea, coochie good, mwah. 

As I finish this, I’m smiling thinking about the moments we've shared and the ones to come. You make life bolder, fabulous (this is a Sex and the City reference, shot every time they say fab), and so so much more fun. Here’s to you on your birthday, a whirlwind of a woman and a true friend. Until we are reunited, know that you are loved beyond words.

Much love,

Ale :P
